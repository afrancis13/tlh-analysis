# Using ARIMA-GARCH for TLH

I wrote this paper in a Time Series modeling course (Statistics 153) at UC Berkeley in Fall 2016.The paper is titled "Using ARIMA-GARCH to Maximize Tax-Adjusted Returns in Tax Loss Harvesting Investment Portfolios." It it attached to this repository, along with the R code that made it possible. None of this is packaged, or distributed (on CRAN) at the moment. The R code is structured in the following manner: functions, script. The functions are used in the script, and the script is utilized to produce the output you see in the document.

This is my first project in the domain of Quantitative Finance. Hope you enjoy looking through it!
